JackTan_Python_SampleCode_ReviewCollection.py

Collect reviews of a product from Amazon. Append the reviews to a file called "reviews.txt". The file should include the 
following TAB-separated columns:

column 1: the review's rating
column 2: the review's title
column 3: the review's date of submission, as it appears on the website
column 4: the FULL review text, exactly as it appears on the website

You may enter any product url onto the console after running the code. 

Why is this line so freakin big?
